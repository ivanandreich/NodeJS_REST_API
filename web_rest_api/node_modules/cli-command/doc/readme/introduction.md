Command execution for command line interfaces, a component of the [toolkit][toolkit].

This module is a binding of the [define][define] and [argparse][argparse] modules to provide option parsing and command execution for more complex programs. If your requirements are not very complex you may prefer to use [argparse][argparse] by itself.
